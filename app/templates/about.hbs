			<p class="lead text-center">The purpose of this organization is to provide a place for members of the community to come together and discuss cybersecurity topics, learn skills that employers require of cybersecurity professionals, as well as to prepare for Capture the Flag (CTF) cybersecurity competitions. Established in 2011, NULLify has competed in numerous CTFs ranging from international competitions to locally hosted (UNO-based) competitions. Competitions utilize skills such as programming, vulnerability discovery, exploitation, reverse engineering, social engineering and so forth. NULLify has had the great fortune of being invited to numerous final round competitions in the past, including trips to Polytechnic Institute of New York University and Iowa State University. NULLify also performs community outreach to local area residents. This is performed by giving talks at the International Cyber Defense Workshop (ICDW), UNO's Academy of Excellence, The Peter Kiewit Institutes college workshop, and to NEbraskaCERT.</p>
